    /*
    When an instance of
    this object is created, the scanner property should be set to a new
    instance of the Scanner class. The class should have the following methods,
    all of which return command line input from the user:

    String getString()
    boolean yesNo()
    int getInt(int min, int max)
    int getInt()
    double getDouble(double min, double max)
    double getDouble()

    The yesNo method should return true if the user enters y, yes, or variants
    thereof, and false otherwise.

    The getInt(int min, int max) method should keep prompting the user for
    input until they give an integer within the min and max. The getDouble
    method should do the same thing, but with decimal numbers.

    Create another class named InputTest that has a static main method that
    uses all the methods from the Input class.
